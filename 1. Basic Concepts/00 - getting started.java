// Static - there is no object of the class present. Thatâ€™s why the main method has to be static so that Java Virtual Machine can load the class into memory and call the main method.

// In Java, static is a keyword used to describe how objects are managed in memory. It means that the static object belongs specifically to the class, instead of instances of that class.
